# Architecture_Logicielle_SVG
This project aims to create a drawing library in Java.  
It is a school project of the Ecole des Mines de Nantes.  
[Mozilla's SVG documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) was chosen as a base for the implementation of the SVG export mode.

## Prerequisites
- This project is developed with [Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html), so you need to have it installed on your computer.
- In order to help your understanding of the project's structure, we created several class diagrams with [ObjectAid](http://www.objectaid.com/). It is obviously not mandatory to have the project working, but highly recommended.
